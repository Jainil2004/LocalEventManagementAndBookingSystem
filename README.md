Local Event Management and Booking System
Project Overview:
The Local Event Management and Reservation System is a console-based application that allows users to interact with a system for managing and booking events. The system has two main types of users: Normal Users and Administrators. Normal Users can register, log in, view a list of available events, search for specific events, book seats for events, and view their booking details. Administrators have additional privileges such as managing users, adding new events, removing events, modifying event details, and viewing all bookings made in the system.

Key Features:

User Authentication:
    Users can register with the system by providing credentials (username, password, email).
    Registered users can log in to access system features.

Event Management:
    Normal Users can view a list of available events and search for events using their unique IDs.
    Administrators can add new events, remove events, and modify event details such as available seats, venue, date, and time.

Booking System:
    Normal Users can book seats for events, and the system tracks booking details.
    Users can view their booking details and a list of events they have booked.

Administrative Functions:
    Administrators can view a list of registered users in the system.
    They can also view all bookings made in the system.

Data Initialization:
    The DataInitializer class is responsible for initializing in-memory data, including events, users, and bookings.
    This class acts as an in-program database, storing objects and facilitating data retrieval.

Future Considerations:
The project has been designed with future database connectivity in mind. The DataInitializer class could serve as a bridge between the in-memory representation of data and a persistent database, allowing for the seamless transition to a more robust database-backed system.

Potential Improvements:

Database Connectivity:
    Implement database connectivity to replace or supplement the in-memory data storage for improved data persistence and scalability.

Concurrency and Transactions:
    Enhance the system to handle concurrent user interactions by implementing transactional operations to maintain data consistency.

Optimizations:
    Consider optimizations such as connection pooling, caching, and asynchronous processing to improve system performance.

User Interface Enhancement:
    Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
